## Build and deploy LLM-based applications

LLMs have gained immense popularity in recent months. An entirely new ecosystem of pre-trained models and tools has emerged that streamline the process of building LLM-based applications.

Here, you will build question answering (QA) service designed to run locally. You will learn how to scale your application using Ray and Anyscale to run it in the cloud. Finally, you will learn how to use modern tools to run your application on the production-grade platform.
